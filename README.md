Simple Expenses Tracker

This is a basic Python-based Expenses Tracker that allows users to record, view, and manage their daily expenses. The program stores all expenses in a CSV file and organizes them by date, amount, category, and description. It’s a simple command-line utility that can be easily extended for further features like generating expense reports or adding filters.

Features

Add Expenses: Users can add expenses specifying the amount, category, and description. The date and time are automatically recorded.

View Expenses: Users can view all the expenses in a table-like format from the CSV file.
